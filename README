This script is a tool for  Unicode chars and conversion.  In fact, its
name is a  pun between the French word "outil"  (tool) and the English
acronyme UTF-8.

Usage:  the tool  works either  with command  line parameters  or with
standard input.  The following two sequences give the same result:

  outilf8 u+e9 '&#171;' c2bb

  outilf8
  u+e9
  &#171;
  c2bb
  ^D

and the result is:

  000000C3A9 U+000000E9 &#233; C-q 351 é LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
  000000C2AB U+000000AB &#171; C-q 253 « LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK
  000000c2bb U+000000BB &#187; C-q 273 » RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK

Another  feature is  grepping the  charnames file  with a  very simple
regexp:

  outilf8 /thorn/

  outilf8
  /thorn/
  ^D

  000000C39E U+000000DE &#222; C-q 336 Þ LATIN CAPITAL LETTER THORN
  000000C3BE U+000000FE &#254; C-q 376 þ LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN
  0000E19AA6 U+000016A6 &#5798; C-q 13246 ᚦ RUNIC LETTER THURISAZ THURS THORN
  0000EA9DA4 U+0000A764 &#42852; C-q 123544 Ꝥ LATIN CAPITAL LETTER THORN WITH STROKE
  0000EA9DA5 U+0000A765 &#42853; C-q 123545 ꝥ LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN WITH STROKE
  0000EA9DA6 U+0000A766 &#42854; C-q 123546 Ꝧ LATIN CAPITAL LETTER THORN WITH STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER
  0000EA9DA7 U+0000A767 &#42855; C-q 123547 ꝧ LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN WITH STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER
